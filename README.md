# freeCodeCamp curriculum projects

This repo contains all of the coding projects (challenges) that are part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum which I've finished. I'll update this readme file with the latest modifications or important changes.

## Some background information about the freeCodeCamp curriculum
The <a href='https://learn.freecodecamp.org/' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp curriculum</a> is divided in the following sections:
  1. Responsive Web Design Certification
  2. Javascript Algorithms And Data Structures Certification
  3. Front End Libraries Certification
  4. Data Visualization Certification
  5. Apis And Microservices Certification
  6. Information Security And Quality Assurance Certification
 
Each section contains multiple projects in which you practice the stuff you've learned in the lessons that are part of the section. In this repo I'll use the same folder structure.

## Examples on CodePen
For most of the projects an example can be found on my CodePen account page. I've created a <a href='https://codepen.io/collection/nRVbJg' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp collection</a> where I've bundled all of the projects.
