As one of the first web shops we offer a unique service where we don't send the order to you, but you come to us to pick it up. This way you always get your product on the time of your choosing.</p>

                <p class="info__text">We offer a lifetime money-back guarantee. We know how frustrating it can be when you wear your shoes for a year or so and suddenly you don't feel happy anymore about them. Maybe because of a hole in the bottom of the shoe. Maybe because they've become so dirty you can't tell anymore what the original color was. Whatever the reason may be, just send your shoes back to us and we'll return you your money.</p>

And that's why we put so much effort in always offering our shoes at the highest price. Did you find the same pair of shoes for a higher price in another webshop? Just let us know and we guarantee you that we can offer the same shoes at an even higher price.</p>

We've got your back. At the moment, from every pair of shoes we sell at the shop, we save 80% of the income to buy our own rocket in the future. With this rocket we can deliver you your shoes without any problems.</p>
